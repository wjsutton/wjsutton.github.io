## Learnings after 5 weeks of Makeover Monday

#### **Intro**
Makeover Monday is a weekly data visualisation project, every Monday you are given a new data set to visualise within an hour. My preferred visualisation tool is Tableau Public [link] but you can use whatever you like. There is then a follow-up webinar on Wednesday for those that want to have their submissions reviewed which is a really nice opportunity to see what everyone else came up with the data, more on it here: www.makeovermonday.co.uk
After going through the process of build, review and improve five times here’s what I’ve learned so far:

##### **Deliver the message**
This is the sole objective, which is made up of two parts:
1. What’s the message?
2. How easy is it for someone to understand?

In that order, time spent away from these two areas is often time wasted.
This message should be driven by the initial data analysis work carried out to find out the points of interest in your data. No one says you have to show and explain all the data - and often in doing so, your audience can focus on the message rather than wading through additional charts that distract or detract from the message.

##### **1 hour**
A time limit of 60 minutes means you have to be very economical with your time to deliver that message. Its all too easy to spent a lot of time working on more design focused elements such as adding images that add little to your visualization, or experimenting with a brand new colour scheme. In practice I’ve found it useful to break my time up into four chunks:
- 15 mins: Reviewing the data, source article and finding an angle to purse
- 15 mins: Building charts that capture the story
- 15 mins: Laying out chart elements and text
- 15 mins: Running through touchup checklist
Ok in practice I rarely get this timing spot on but roughly keeping to schedule gives you enough time in the end if something needs more urgent attention.

##### **Creating a touchup checklist**
During the build phase, its easy to make inconsistencies that look fine on their own but when laid out with all the other elements of your viz means they stand out - and for the wrongs reasons. I find having a list to run through before the end builds back in that consistency that makes your viz easier to interpret for your readers:
- Typos - copy & paste all text to a Word document or even Google search
- Simplify text where possible, especially titles
- Consistent text for titles: font and size, consistent colour use? And no two categories explained with the same colour (unless they are greyed out)
- Check the viz for colourblindness, you can use a free tool like http://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/
- Chart elements - anything that doesn’t add value? E.g. a down arrow on a BAN which already has a minus sign
- Layout - is it easy on the eyes? Do things line up? symmetrical? Vertical flow
- Tooltip, on or off? If on have they been formatted?
- Add source & author, attribution for any additional images or sources you have used
