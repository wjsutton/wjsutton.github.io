## Project Walkthroughs: Crow Scarer

Crow Scarer Build
#### **Intro & Motivations**
During the springtime at my parents home, they have ducklings however sometime crows will come and take the ducklings away for food, nature is pretty cruel, right? Surely with all the tech out there is there some humane way the ducklings can live without us harming the crows?
Now if you were expecting an advanced machine learning algorithm to detect crows and deploy some anti-crow gismo I’m sorry not yet. This project, however, produces a portable crow scarer for domestic use.
Kit required
 - Crowaway cd
 - Computer to rip mp3 from cd
 - Wireless speaker
 - Micro SD Memory card
 - Micro SD to USB adapter
 - Crowaway is a CD containing “crow distress” noises, which scares away the crows from an area. 
 
However it comes as a CD, we have a dated CD player that could play it but it would require a fair extension cord to be of any use. Portable Bluetooth speakers are available that can also play music held locally on a memory card. So all that is need is ripping the music Crowaway CD and saving the file on a memory card and inserting it into a speaker.
Some notes:
It isn’t waterproof, for our use if it rained we put it in a small bag with a hole at one side so the speaker was mostly sheltered and the noises still got out. However waterproof speakers are available and in theory, would work.
It requires charging each evening, this was ok for our use as we don’t need the crow scarer playing all night so can bring the speaker into charge at night. A workaround for this could be using a solar-powered battery pack to continuously charge the speaker during daylight.
