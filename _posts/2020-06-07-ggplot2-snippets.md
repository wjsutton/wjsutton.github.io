### R ggplot2 Templates

ggplot2 is the go-to package for creating data visualisations with R, with the vast majority of chart types supported or possible with additional packages. 

There are many websites and tutorials to get started. From experience, they provide good, approachable examples but lack options on how to alter the aesthetics of the charts. The aesthetics (referring to ggplot2’s theme and labelling) are crucially important for the ease and interpretability of the visuals you produce.   

I found myself Googling endless questions:
- How do I add a title?
- How do I change the font size?
- How do I remove the grey background?

⚠️ In the end, I found I was spending more time on Google than wanted. ⚠️

💡 So I created a Github repo to make my own set of templates to refer to. 💡

The [Github repo](https://github.com/wjsutton/ggplot2_snippets) offers a selection of chart templates each chart has:
- A clean theme easy to customise included
- Comments at each line of the ggplot2 code
- Code for saving of the charts locally as png/gif
