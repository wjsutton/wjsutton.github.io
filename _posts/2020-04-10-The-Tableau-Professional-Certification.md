## Passing the Tableau Desktop Certified Professional Qualification

<img src="/assets/images/desktop-certified-professional-300x300.png" align="left" style="width:30%;height:30%;padding-right:10px;">

The Tableau Desktop Certified Professional Qualification is the last of three exams you can take to demonstrate and prove your ability with the desktop product. To attempt the test you need to have passed the level 2 exam (Certified Associate) and are recommended to have been using the product for over a year - more details can be found here: [https://www.tableau.com/en-gb/learn/certification/desktop-certified-professional](https://www.tableau.com/en-gb/learn/certification/desktop-certified-professional)

What it boils down to is:
- Knowing what you’re going to be tested on
- Knowing what they want to see
- Knowing where to improve

### What you’re going to be tested on

The version tested from the exam, then reviewing what has been released to the product up to that version [https://www.tableau.com/en-gb/products/all-features](https://www.tableau.com/en-gb/products/all-features) you may end up tested specifically on features that were introduced several versions ago. 

The format of mocks, at the time of writing there, is only one mock available online - use this to get an idea of the calibre of questions you’ll be asked in each of the sections.

This gives you an exam syllabus to work towards, a resource you can use to identify areas that require more focused effort.

### What they want to see

Often we have a picture in our heads about what best practice looks like, however, we’re not marking this exam - Tableau is. Reviewing their documents provides good direction on what they want to see and where you should spend your time when against the clock.
- What chart [https://www.tableau.com/en-nz/learn/whitepapers/which-chart-or-graph-is-right-for-you](https://www.tableau.com/en-nz/learn/whitepapers/which-chart-or-graph-is-right-for-you)
- Visual best practices [https://www.tableau.com/learn/whitepapers/tableau-visual-guidebook](https://www.tableau.com/learn/whitepapers/tableau-visual-guidebook)
- Effective dashboard design [https://www.tableau.com/learn/whitepapers/building-effective-dashboards-it-user](https://www.tableau.com/learn/whitepapers/building-effective-dashboards-it-user)

Take notes from these, it can be helpful to build a checklist of what Tableau consider best practice.

>Two takeaways I found:
>- Formatted Tooltips: taking the time to construct tooltips that add value than the default, e.g. “Sales in the US for 2018 were $300K” rather than “US: $300K” 
>- Descriptive Titles: Saying “Global sales rose 25% from 2016 to 2018” rather than “Global Sales, 2016-2018”

These are little changes that take 1-2 minutes to do but make a difference - very good to keep in mind when you’re reviewing your work with limited time left.

### Where to improve
**Identify gaps in knowledge**

From pulling together everything you’re going to be tested on should give you a list of topics/product features, some used regularly some not so much. The objective is to get confident with all of these in case they are tested. 

>I identified weaknesses with Level of Detail (LOD) calculations and Set & Parameter Actions, it then becomes a matter of setting aside time to tackle these topics individually and look for applications for my day to day work. 

For set actions I found Lindsey Poulter’s blog a valuable resource [http://www.lindseypoulter.com/tag/set-actions/](http://www.lindseypoulter.com/tag/set-actions/) and then started practising her techniques and others which I built a dashboard:

<a href='https://public.tableau.com/profile/will7508#!/vizhome/PracticingSetActions/TblCalcWeightedAvg'><img alt=' ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Pr&#47;PracticingSetActions&#47;SetActionsDrilldown&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a>

Similarly, with the weaknesses you find, look for examples from Tableau and the community and then recreate them with another data source. 

**Practice against the clock**

During the exam, you’ll be asked to produce many sheets and dashboards in a much short timeframe then you’d expect in a work environment. So being able to create visually effective content at speed is vital with no knowledge of what data you’re going to be dealing with. 

I’ve found Makeover Monday [https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk) an excellent community project to help build the muscle memory for building charts quickly, they have a back catalogue of datasets on their website and webinar reviews so you can see what others have done and hear feedback on how effective their work is.

In part with tackling these datasets, you can practice building charts under time pressure. 
- Start with 1 hour to produce a dashboard from one of their datasets 
- Record the time you take deciding on a story, building charts, formatting charts for when you're looking on where you can speed up
- Then try building dashboards in 30 minutes

>I noticed I would spend a large proportion of time formatting charts, e.g. I would format a chart, then decide I didn’t need it and delete it. 

If you are feeling comfortable building with a 30 minutes deadline try building multiple dashboards in a set time. Viz fatigue is a real thing, only something I learnt attempting a 3 hour mock to make 6 Makeover Monday charts. 

Remember this is about improving your time effectiveness, not perfection
- Give your best shot
- Review in line with what they want to see
- Highlight areas to focus on for next time

And then practice more. Lots of practice. This doesn’t come overnight, but forming a routine of regular practice as part of community projects or otherwise helps the development of your skills.
