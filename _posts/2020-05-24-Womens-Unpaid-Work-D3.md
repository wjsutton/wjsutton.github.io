### Women remain unpaid for the actual hours they work in the United States

Data from [UN Stats](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/timeuse/index.html) shows us the time adults in the United States spend working paid and unpaid hours. The data shows consistently that women on average spend more time carrying out work that results in no pay.

The trend from 2003 - 2015 remains consistent each year that for 7 hours of work a woman will only be paid for 3 of them.
