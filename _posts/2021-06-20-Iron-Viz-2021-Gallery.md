#### Some notes about the gallery

Content curation:
- The process gathers data from Twitter, finding tweets including #ironviz or #ironviz2021 and a link to a Tableau Public Viz
- It doesn't collect all tweets due to user preferences on data collection, so any missed submissions are welcome to be included
- Some tweets are excluded as viz being shared isn't a submission to 2021's ironviz, examples are sharing a previous years submission or sharing a project viz (e.g. Makeover Monday) and trying to increase the reach of the viz, if I've wrongly excluded a viz let me know 

The gallery page:
- The images are extracted from the Tableau public link, details available here: [https://github.com/wjsutton/tableau_public_api#user-content-books-workbook-image](https://github.com/wjsutton/tableau_public_api#user-content-books-workbook-image)
- Images are arranged by a CSS photo grid, details of which is here: [https://css-tricks.com/seamless-responsive-photo-grid/](https://css-tricks.com/seamless-responsive-photo-grid/)
- The order of the vizzes is determined at random and refreshed with each update, this is to give every a fair chance of being near the top and for users to see new vizzes when they revisit the page 
- Each image links back to Twitter so you can see what the author says about their work, and gives you the chance to give feedback and support on the viz, as well as a link to the Tableau public viz  

2020's submission gallery is still available to view here: 
<br>[https://wjsutton.github.io/ironviz2020.html](https://wjsutton.github.io/ironviz2020.html)
